Authentication: The system provides authentication functionality for doctors, patients, and admins. Users can create accounts, log in securely, and access personalized features based on their roles.

Real-time Communication: A real-time chat feature is implemented, allowing patients and doctors to engage in private conversations. This fosters effective communication, enables patients to ask questions, and helps doctors provide timely advice and guidance.

Rating System: Patients have the ability to rate doctors based on their consultation experiences. This rating system ensures transparency and accountability, helping other patients make informed decisions when choosing a healthcare professional.

Database Integration: The system securely stores patient and doctor information in an SQLite database. This includes user profiles, symptoms, disease predictions, and consultation history, facilitating easy access to past records and ensuring data confidentiality.
